I originally had this long contrived blogpost all written up about social media and how to systematically get famous on it, however I feel like there's a better discussion to be had about social media-- Algorithms, and how they have failed us.

<h3>Choice Paralysis</h3>
You ever wanted to watch a movie with a friend, family, or significant other, unknowing what you wanted? Surprisingly, this is a common thing. Its called <b>Choice Paralysis</b>.<br>
