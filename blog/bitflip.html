<h2>A Bit-WHAT?</h2>
There comes a time in every tech nerd's life where something completely unexplainable happens to them all at once. Something that makes you absolutely question the entire merit of technology as we know it.<br>
I'd like to call it, the Tech Kruger effect.<br><i>The more you know about tech the more confusing it becomes</i>
<img src="Assets/techkruger.png" title="A version of the Dunning Kruger Effect graph, where the Y axis is 'Confusion' and the X axis is 'Tech Knowledge''.
There is a giant hill of Confusion at the very start, followed by a slight increase after the hill reaches back to 0, the high points labeled 'what the fuck just happened?', while the low point inbetween is labeled 'oh the answer is simple'">
Well, something happened to me that i can only say had an astronomical (heh) chance of occurring.<br>
A Bit Flip.
<h3>Bit-Flip?</h3>
A bitflip is an often and inconspicuous type of interference that befalls almost every computer. It mostly impacts RAM, but it can impact most (if not all) types of storage. When it impacts RAM its oftentimes minor or inconsequential in nature, largely because of how nonvolatile RAM is in general. However, problems could arrive once it occurs to other forms of storage, particularly embedded NAND flash storage, like the ones found on smartphones. One of the most common signs to tell that a bitflip occurred is the presence of sudden and widespread failure of systems in close proximity of eachother. If a bitflip caused the failure of one device, its likely to impact another in a similar vein.

<h3>The series of events</h3>
Basically, at around 10:00 PM CST, I was playing Team Fortress 2, wanting to play the <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=206148">New Update</a>, wanting to play Versus Saxton Hale (which was removed from the Casual Map List for a server-crashing bug), I joined a Community server. Round starts, everything is normal. I notice, however, the Saxton Hale model was glitching in a similar manner as if my GPU was bugging out. I made a comment on the community server on how saxton hale was bugging out my GPU. Boom. Team Fortress 2 crashed.

<i style="font-size:50%;">Note: because I did not take a screenshot of the game before it crashed, I have to add supplementary images to help demonstrate the visual glitch that occurred to the Saxton Hale 3D model before TF2 crashed. Please note that the effect was far more extreme and spanned the entirety of the map, while the demo from the renderer library <a href="https://github.com/pskl/glitch3d">Glitch3d</a> is more localized to the limits of the 3D model.</i><br>
"Thats fine.", I foolishly thought. "Must've been a pibby glitch" said the part of my brain half eaten by a <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/cdn/shop/products/product_ori_plush_itemview_360x360.png?v=1583264052">rat</a>. "I'll just relaunch TF2. I'll try to join back to the community server-"

<center>Oh.<br>
Oh No.

After a brief panic around whether or not I was VAC banned (Thankfully I wasn't), I went into research mode. I went to the link on the error message (Why isn't it an embed, Valve?), and what I basically got was that I should restart my computer If I was a good faith user. I did such the thing. While I waited in the admittibly short period of time inbetween poweroff and boot, I went to grab my phone. Might as well browse <a href="https://wetdry.world/@ioletsgo">wetdry.world</a> while my impatient ass waited like, 4 seconds. Surely this situation can't get any weirder-

<center> Oh...<br>
Oh No...<br>
Oh God Please No...<br>
Fuck.<br>
Shit Fuck.<br>
Mother of Fuck.</center>
My phone was bricked. Hard Bricked. Won't even turn on. or boot. Now what could possibly cause the spontaneous failure of two entirely disconnected devices in similar proximity to eachother, That's right, A bitflip. I am currently writing this at 5 in the morning.<br>
This has been a headache and I'm exhausted. I tried to play TF2 after all this stress but I was met with indecipherable nonsense dialog boxes and incomprehensible error messages

<br><b>TL;DR</b>, I don't have a phone for a little bit. And I'm locked out of my Steam account because the universe decided against that.<br>
<br>How has your day been!
