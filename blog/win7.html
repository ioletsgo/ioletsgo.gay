<h2>Windows 7, eWaste, and the modern day Malware</h2>
Windows 7 is an operating system that runs near and dear to my heart. I do admit that I have a little bit of nostalgia towards Windows 7, from the skeuomorphism of the calculator app, to the lovely blues and cyans that fill the Frutiger Aero aesthetic. I have fond(ish) memories of filling up my family computer with all different types of malware. Exploring all these interesting osbcure websites that I probably only saw through advertisements or through word of mouth.<br>

Windows 7 in my mind was the last era that we truly had "The Wild West" of the internet, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, <i>nor would I say it's a particularly great thing either.</i>
