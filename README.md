# ioletsgo.gay
[ioletsgo.gay](https://ioletsgo.gay) is a website designed with the idea to replicate and/more mimic a lot of early internet techniques, like the inability to accomidate for different screen resolutions, while also being hard to read with the formatting of the text and website layout.
The website uses minimal CSS because of how most websites of the era barely used CSS, thus using vast amounts of CSS for the site would be kind of redundant.
