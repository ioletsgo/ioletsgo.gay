# ioletsgo.gay
iolesgo.gay is a website designed with the idea to replicate and/more mimic a lot of early internet techniques, like the inability to accomidate for different screen resolutions, while also being hard to read with the formatting of the text and website layout.

# Acknowledgments
ioletsgo.gay would not be possible without the people at [Archive.org](https://archive.org), nor would it be possible for this website to exist without any of these other people. Due to the fidelity of these websites, do to the age of the websites, I will be providing archive.org mirrors for the websites and the contents of the websites.
